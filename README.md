# USDZ_converter
### What it does
Converts OBJ or FBX files to USDZ using Blender 4.0.

### Requirements 
- have Blender 4.0+ installed.
- have a 3d model as OBJ or FBX that you'd like to convert

### Setup
- download the "Convert_to_USDZ.py" and "USDZ_convert.bat" files
- place the "Convert_to_USDZ.py"  file into a "dependancy folder" wherever. (I have a bunch of various bat scripts that rely on various python scripts, so they all get placed in a dependacy folder)
- open the "USDZ_convert" BAT file in notepad, and change the "BLENDER_PATH" and "PYTHON_SCRIPT" directories to match your config.

### Usage
- place the "USDZ_convert.BAT" file in a folder that contains a OBJ or FBX 3d model
- double click to run it (or run it via CMD)
- if successful, you'll have a USDZ file outputted into the same folder.
